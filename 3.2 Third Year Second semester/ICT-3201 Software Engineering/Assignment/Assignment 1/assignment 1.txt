Here is an example of two user stories, flow of events, use case diagram, and architectural design for a software system under development:

User Story 1: As a customer, I want to be able to create an account on the online shopping website so that I can purchase items.

User Story 2: As a customer, I want to be able to search for items on the online shopping website by keyword and filter my search by price range and category, so that I can find the products I am interested in quickly and easily.

Flow of Events:

The customer opens the online shopping website and clicks on the "Create Account" button.
The website displays the account creation form.
The customer fills out the form with their personal information and creates a username and password.
The website verifies that the entered information is valid and unique.
The website creates the customer's account and logs them in.
The customer searches for items by entering a keyword and selecting filters.
The website displays the search results, sorted by relevance.
The customer selects an item to view more information.
The website displays the item details and allows the customer to add the item to their cart.

Architectural Design:
The software system is designed using a microservices architecture, with each service running in a separate container. The services are organized around business capabilities and are independently deployable. The main services in the system include:

Customer Service: Handles customer account creation and login.
Search Service: Handles product search and filtering.
Product Service: Handles product information and recommendations.
Order Service: Handles order placement and tracking.
These services communicate with each other through APIs. The system also includes a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of each service, and a cache to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
