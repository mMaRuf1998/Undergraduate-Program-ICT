Probability
and Distribution:


Why does probability distribution associated with
simulation? Give examples of the use of discrete and continuous probability
distribution in simulation.


Conditional probability


Define Negative Binomial Distribution and geometric
distribution. Write the application of these distribution in simulation.


What are the application of Q-Q and P-P plot?

seconds.


Regression:


Assumptions


What is regression analysis and how do you should
select dependent and independent variables?


 


Inference


Chi-square Goodness-of-fit Test is widely use after
